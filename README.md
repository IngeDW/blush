A Dating app, created with Node.js and Express. Blush is the result of Project Tech's team assignment, commissioned by Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. We combined our individual use cases and developed a dating app. The user can sign in or create an account. The database is designed with Mongoose Models and Schemas and corresponds with mongoDB Atlas.
