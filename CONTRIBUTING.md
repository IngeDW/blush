## Style guide
Most of our style guides can be found in the ESLint config file. The first en foremost; our code should be easy to read for everyone. We'll use comments to clarify what the code does, for others and other team members.

* Arrow-functions: always use arrow functions, except for methods
* Comma-Spacing: there will be no space(s) in front of comma's and at least one comma behind one
* Empty spaces: use no more than two empty spaces between code snippets and no more than one empty line on end of page
* Functions: always use function expressions
* Implicit arrow linebreak: body's of arrow function that return a single value will be put besides the declaration
* Indent: use indentation of two spaces
* Variables: only use `let` or `const` and no ~~`var`~~
* Quotes: use single quotes consistently
* Semicolons: alway end lines of code with a semicolon
